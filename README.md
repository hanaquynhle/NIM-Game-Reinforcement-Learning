# NIM-Game-Reinforcement-Learning
For this programming assignment, we will be visiting the game of NIM. Here is the relevant information about the game:
 There are two players. For this assignment, your program should have one human player (the user)
and one computer player. The computer player should move first.
 Between the two players is a pile of sticks. The pile should always start at 10 – changing the value
will cause the learning to fail.
 The players take turns (the computer player should start). Each turn, the player takes some number
of sticks from the pile in the middle. You should allow players to take up to 3 sticks.
 The winner of the game is the player that takes the last stick from the pile.
